## Setup
### Requirements
- Project Conda env that will be contained in a cuda and no cuda version
- Afterwards install Pytorch3d(https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md) and its dependencies: This requires actually cloning python3d GitHub repo and installing it from source. The installation relies on Visual Studio 2019 build tools(with clang) and https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/
